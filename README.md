# tobias funkÃ« - actor, therapist, discord bot
I just found out that my cellular telephone was a lemon. It didn't work.

### Run locally
* Clone the repo
* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* Create a .env file at the root of the directory
* Add the Discord Bot token variable to .env, like this:
  `TOKEN=token-goes-here`
* Run `node index.js` to start the server
